This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Details

- Basic Appointment app created from [this React course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-js-building-an-interface-8551484).
- Uses useState, useEffects, useCallback, Tailwind CSS, etc.
- Data is static from a json file (but requested via fetch to simulate a real API call).
- Added some small personal touches during development, like the colors and the Sort By arrow changing direction on state change.
- Node v16.20.0
